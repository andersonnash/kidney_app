## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I think I know what I want my page to look like and how I want it to function.

### Weaknesses:

Not too comfortable with the CRUD process

### Opportunities:

I'm hoping that I can dig deep and remember everything from the last tow weeks to make this P2 really shine.

### Threats:

Hoping to not get stuck on one thing and wasting a lot of time.
